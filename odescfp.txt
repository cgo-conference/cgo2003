				CALL FOR PAPERS
			   	===============

  1st Workshop on Optimizations for DSP and Embedded Systems (ODES)
  held in conjunction with CGO (Int. Sym. on code generation and
optimization)
                   March  2003, San Francisco, CA, USA

		SUBMISSION DEADLINE:  JANUARY 17, 2003



  The performance requirements of digital signal processing and 
embedded applications are rapidly increasing, but the power and cost 
budgets are decreasing. Optimization plays a very important role in 
managing the conflicting demands. The focus of this workshop is to 
understand the various optimization strategies applicable to the 
design of DSP and embedded systems for performance, power, and cost. 
  

TOPICS OF INTEREST
------------------
  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
  
  * Algorithmic transformations and code/software optimizations
  * Hardware and software optimizations for low-power consumption
    and/or code density
  * Coprocessor and hardware accelerators
  * Compiler techniques and code generation for media processing
  * Frameworks for profiling and scheduling tasks (multiple/
    concurrent) on various hardware resources (single-core + 
    hardware accelerators, dual-core, system-on-a-chip, etc)
  * Hardware/software tradeoffs with ASICs, FPGA's, DSPs, 
    general-purpose processors, microcontrollers, etc as 
    building blocks
  * Retargetable compilers and reconfigurable architectures
